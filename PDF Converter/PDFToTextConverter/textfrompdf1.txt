North Korean Drug Traﬃcking: Allegations and Issues for
Congress
Raphael F. Perl, Foreign Aﬀairs and National Defense Division
Updated September 14, 1999
Abstract. At least thirty documented incidents, many involving arrest or detention of North Korean diplomats,
link North Korea to drug traﬃcking. Such events, in the context of ongoing, credible, but unproven, allegations
of large scale state sponsorship of drug production and traﬃcking, raise important issues for the Congress,
the Administration, and America’s allies in combating international drug traﬃcking. The challenge to policy
makers, is how to pursue an eﬀective counter drug policy and comply with U.S. law which may require
cutting oﬀ aid to North Korea while pursuing other high priority U.S. foreign policy objectives including: (1)
limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction; (2) limiting ballistic missile production
and export; (3) curbing terrorism, counterfeiting and international crime; and (4) addressing humanitarian needs.

North Korean Drug Trafficking: Allegations and
Issues for Congress

Summary
At least 34 documented incidents, many involving arrest or detention of Nort h
K orean diplomats, link No rth Korea to drug trafficking.   Such events, in the context of
ongoin g, credible, but unproven, allegations of large scale state sponsorship of dru g
p roduction and trafficking ,  raise important issues for the Congress, the Administration,
and America’s allies in combating  international drug trafficking.  The challenge to policy
makers, is how to pursue an effective counter drug policy and comply with U.S. la w
w hich may require cutting off  aid to North Korea while pursuing other high priority U.S.
 policy objectives including: (1) limiting possession and production of weapons
of mass de struction; (2) limiting ballistic missile production and export; (3) curbin g
terrorism, counterfeiting and internation al crime, and (4) addressing humanitarian needs.
U. S. aid to North Korea is currently limited to providing food and othe r
humanitarian assistance  together with heavy fue l oil shipments under a 1994 U.S.-North
Korea agreement. Reports that North Korea may be limiting some of  its food cro p
producti on in favor of drug crop production are particularly disturbing, though th e
acreage in question is comparatively small.  A nother issue of rising concern is the degree
to which profits from any North Korean drug trafficking, counte rfeiting, and other crime-
for-profit enterprises may be used to directly und erwrite — or free funds from elsewhere
to underwrite — the costs of maintaining or expanding North Korean nuclear programs.
This report will be updated if warranted by new developments. 
Background.  Allegations of North Korean drug production, trafficking, and crime-
f - profit  activity have become the focus of rising congressional attention. On October
28,  1997, Senators Grassley and Helms sent a letter to Secretary of State Albright ,
q uestioning w hy North Korea was not included in the Department’s annual International
 Control Strategy Report [INCSR].  They noted that press reports indicate d
North Korea’s 1995 opium production level was 40 metric tons [roughly comparable to
M exico’s]—an amount clearly over the 1,000 hec tare threshold for designation as a major

 drug producing country.  More recently, on March 5, 19 99, Representatives Gilman,
 Hyde, Cox, and Knollenberg sent a letter to Special North  Korea Polic y
C oordinator, William J. Perry, which stressed that his po licy report to the President should
address [among other key policy points] the issue of North Korean narcotics production
and trafficking.
The provisions of th e Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 referred to above require that
count cultivating 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy be subject to annua l
[March first]  drug reporting and certification procedures and that certain aid be withheld
and discretionary trade sanctio ns be imposed unless the President determines that: (1) the
coun has “cooperated fully” with the United States or taken “adequate  steps” on it s
own to curb drug trafficking and production; or (2) “vital national interests” requir e
2
pro of assistance.  Also prohibited is assistance to “any individual or entity
 provided] that the President knows or has reason to believe...has been a
 assistor, abettor, conspirator, or colluder in the illicit trafficking in any suc h
[controlled] substance.”  Notably,  the Act permi ts exceptions to restrictions on furnishing
 when the President determines that providing assistance is  “important to th e
security interests o f the United States.  International disaster assistance [such as the food
aid received by North Korea] is specifically exempted from all limitations on providin g
3
assistance under the Act.
U.S. forei gn  aid to North Korea is severely restricted because of North Korea’ s
design by the U.S. Secretary of State as a country that has “repeatedly provide d
4
 for acts of international terrorism.” Assistance i s currently limited to humanitarian
assista (food) and petroleum assistance, i.e. heavy fuel oil for electrical generatin g
 as an alternative to nuclear generation of electrical power, negotiated i n
respon to serious concerns that North Korea was developing a nuclear weapon s
ca In Fiscal Year 1998, North Korea received $183.4 million in food assistanc e
and an additional $215 million thus far for FY1999.  U.S. petroleum assistance to North
Korea had a dollar value of $58 million in 1998 and is set at  $31.5 million for the yea r

1999.

 North Korea n climate and soil are relatively inhospitable to poppy cultivation and fertilizer
is in short supply.  Best guess U.S. government estimates are that such conditions would yiel d
roughly the equivalent of 10 kilogram of opium gum per hectare with 40mt of raw opiu m
indicative of 3,000 to 4,000 hectares of poppy cultivation.

Acc to South Korean sources, North Korea’s legal exports are expected t o
decline by 42.5% in 1998 to $520 million from $904 million in 1997, while imports will
6
d rease 23% from $1.27 billion to $980 million , exacerbating the nation’s already dire
need for hard currency.  Among other things, hard currency is required to meet th e
 costs of North Korea’s nuclear program which according to an informa l
7
interagency consolidated estimate approximates $200 million per year at current levels .
Allegations of Drug Trafficking.  The Department of State’s March 1, 199 8
8
 , includes information on North Korea in its money laundering section whic h
 in part as follows: “The most profitable lines of state- supported illegal businesses
remain drug trafficking, gold smuggling, illegal sale and distri bution of endangered species,
traf of counterfeit U.S. currency, and rare earth metals.... North Korean official s
ap to be increasing their involvement in financial crimes as a means to generat e
o perational funds and support t heir country’s anemic economy.” The 1999 INCSR  reads
 part, “ as the reports [on DPRK drug activity] multiply and the incidents cumulate i t
 more likely than not that the state itself is involved in criminal activity.  Fo r
example, alleged large sc ale opium cultivation could likely not be undertaken without the
expl knowledge of the North Korean government.  The same could be said of larg e
scale imports of ephedrine, a known precursor chemical for methamphetamine.”
 over North Korean drug production and trafficking are also expressed in
the 1997 R eport of the International Narcotics Control Board [INCB]. The Report, i n
circumsp ect language common to such U.N. documents, notes that “The Board ha s
receiv disquieting reports on the drug control situation in the Democratic People’ s
R epublic of Korea.  Therefore, the Board expresses its concern that the government of the
D emocratic People’s Republic of Korea has n ot yet accepted its proposal, originally made
9
in 1995, to send a mission to that country to study and clarify drug control issues.”
U.S. Drug Enf orcement Administration (DEA) data and a plethora of domestic and
fore press reports portray an ongoing  pattern of drug trafficking, trafficking o f
10
cou U.S. currency , and other smuggling-for- profit activities by North Korea n
diploma ts over the past 24 years. Since 1976, North Korea has been linked to over 3 4
verifiable inc idents involving drug seizures in at least 14 countries.  A significant number
o f these cases has involved  arrest or detention of North Korean diplomats or officials.  All
but four o f these incidents have transpired in the 1990’s with 10 incidents occuring from

January 1998 to September 1999. In 1999, substantial seizures of North Korea n
11
methamphetamine occurred in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 
Press reports ci ting North Korean defectors and South Korean intelligence sources,
 well as U.S. government investigative agency source material, paint a grim picture of
an anemic economy in North Korea, held back by disproportionate military spending ,
 economic policies and the consequences of a broad economic and trad e
embargo led by the United States since th e Korean War.  Pressed for cash, and perceiving
its vital national security at stake, the regime reportedly created an office to bring i n
foreign currency: “Bureau No. 39,” under the ruling Korean Worker’s Party which i s
12
 by North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il.   This office  is reported to be  in charge
o f drug trafficking and according to some reports  all crime-for-profit activity including:
(1) opium production and trafficking; (2) methamphetamine production and trafficking ;
(3) counterfeiting; and (4)  s muggling.  Drugs are reportedly exported through China and
 to Asia and Europe via government trading companies, diplomatic pouches, and
commercial carg o. Money earned is reportedly used to: (1)  buy loyalty from Party elites
and military leaders to Leader Kim Jong Il; (2) fund costs of overseas diplomatic missions;
 (3) finance national security  activity — especially technology and electroni c
13
purchases for the intelligence and military services.
Farmers in certain areas reportedly are ordered to grow opium poppy, wit h
cultivation estimate s of 4,000 hectares for the early 1990’s  and 7,000 hectares for 1995.
C urrent production, however,  is believed to be belo w 1995 figures because of heavy rains
and the broa d decline of agricultural output as a consequence of poor policies, an d
 fertilizer and insecticides. Looking at all available estimates, a cultivatio n
estimate of 3000-4,000 hectares for 1998 would appear reas onable, but nevertheless based
o n indirect and fragmented information.   U.S. government investigative agency sources

E.g,  May 1976, 400 kg  hashish seized from a North Korean [DPRK] diplomat in Egypt; July
1 994, Chinese officials arrested a Chinese nation al on charges of smuggling 6 kg. of North Korean
produced heroin through the DPRK Embassy in China; August 1994, DPRK intelligence agen t
 by Russian authorities for trying to sell heroin to Russian mafia group; January 1995 ,
C hinese officials in Shanghai seized 6 kg. of heroin and arrested two DPRK nationals, one with a
diplomatic passport; July 1998, DPRK diplomat arrested in Egypt with 500,000 tablets o f
rohyp so called “date rape” drug ; Jan. 1998, Russian officials arrested two DPR K
diploma ts  in Moscow with 35 kg. of cocaine smuggled through Mexico; Oct. 1998, Germa n
official s arrested a DPRK diplomat in Berlin seizing heroin believed made in North Korea; an d
May 1999, Taiwanese officials seized 157 kg of methamphetamine said to be DPRK produced. 
 April 1998 Russian police reportedly arrested Kil Chae Kyong [personal secretary in charge
of secret funds f or Kim Jong Il] on charges of trying to sell $30,000 in counterfeit U.S. currency.

e e North Korean raw opium production capacity at 50 tons annually, with 40 tons
reportedly produced in 1995.  North Korean government pharmaceutical labs reportedly
14
have the capacity to process 100 tons of raw opium per year.
Methamphet production in North Korea is reported to have started in 199 6
after heavy rains decreased income from poppy production. This coincides with a tim e
 markets for methamphetamine are dramatically expanding in Asia, especially i n
15
Thai Japan, and the Philippines.  North Korea’s maximum methamphetamin e
production capacity  is estimated to be 10-15 tons of the highest quality product fo r
export. According to the INCB, North Korean legitimate pharmaceutical needs fo r
 [a traditional precursor for methamphetamine] are 2.5 tons  per year, one ton
higher than U.S. investigative a gency  source estimates. INCB officials confirm receipt of
16
 of North Korean involvement in a diversion of 20 tons of ephedrine.
M oreover, the DPRK may be bypassing the highly reg ulated market for ephedrine in favor
o f an alternate techno logy for a benzine based product, raising speculation  that U.S. and
allied petroleum assistance to North Korea may be used to sustain illicit drug production.
Conservative estimates suggest North K orean criminal activity,  carefully targeted to
m eet specific needs,  generated about $85 million in 1997: $71 million from drugs and$15
17
n from counterfeiting.  Looking at all available estimates, a $100 million figure ,
 admittedly low, falls in the general  range where estimates overlap. However ,
there are strong indications that the figures are considerably higher: “$500 million to $ 1
18
billion annually from criminal activities”. 
If credence is to be given to U.N., Department of State reporting, and DEA shared
inform as well as press reports citing North Korean defectors and South Korea n
intelligence sources, a pat tern of activity emerges which indicates that: (1)  in the 1970’s,
N orth Korean officials bought and sold foreign source illicit drugs; (2) in the mid-1970’s,
North Korea b egan cultivating opium poppy as a matter of state policy; (3) in the mi d

13, 1998. Total arable land in the DPRK is estimated to exceed  1.3 million hectares.
  August 1998, Japanese auth orities arrested members of a Japanese criminal organization and
seized 200 kg of a 300 kg shipment of methamphetamine believed manufactured in North Korea.
E arlier, in April, 58.6 kg of the same drug, thought to have been ma nufactured in China, was seized
by Japanese authorities in the cargo of a North Korean freighter. See: Police say seized drugs
originated in North Korea,  Yomiuri Shimbun (Japan), Jan. 8, 1999.

For exampl e, in January, 1998 Thai police reportedly  seized, but later released,  2.5 tons o f
ephedrine en route from India to North Korea. This was reportedly part of an 8 ton shipment North
K orea had attempted to purchase which th e INCB reportedly limited [but formally denies limiting]
to two 2.5 ton shipments over a two y ear period. Pyongyang reportedly argued for the right to buy
30 tons from India— enough for a 135 year supply of cold tablets (see Bankok Times, 6/13/99,
p.6.
 $71 m illion for drugs breaks down as $59 million from opium/heroin and $12 million from
amphetamines, although one, admittedly speculative , U.S. la w enforcement agency source estimate
for “world” market price of heroin produced by the DPRK in 1995 is $600 million.  For the $15
million figure on counterfeiting, see:  Korea Herald, November 16, 1998.

1 980’s, North Korea began refini ng opium poppy for export and exporting refined opium
p roducts; (4) and i n the mid-1990’s, after heavy rains reduced opium production in 1995
and 1996, North Korea, began manufacturing and exporting methamphetamine t o
expanding markets in Southeast Asia.  If this patter n reflects reality, an important question
is the degree to which the government of North Ko rea may respond to  increased financial
p ures and expanding methamphetamine markets by dramatically increasing currently
repor ted levels of drug trafficking activity. Recent seizures of DPRK sourc e
m etamine in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea may well reflect such a disturbing
trend.
Some analysts, howeve r, question the reliability of information reported in the press
attributed to North Korean defectors and South Korean governmen t sources in the context
o f what is seen as a cold war propaganda battle between the two Koreas. They note that
 a closed state such as North Korea “hard” data is difficult to obtain, thus what i s
obtained is fragmentary and indirect at best. North Korea continues to dismiss  medi a
reports and speculation on government  involvement in drug trafficking activities a s
slander based on politically motivated adversary propaganda sources such as South Korean
intelligen services.  North Korean officials stress privately that corruption, drug use ,
trafficking, and criminal activity in general are maladies to which individuals in  all societies
m ay fall prey, and that  any in volvement by North Korean individuals in such activity is in
no way state-connected or state sanctioned. Further, officials have stressed that i n
instances where such activity has come to the attention of authorities, individuals involved
have bee n duly punished. Finally, DPRK officials maintain that drug trafficking an d
p roduction are matters that should be handled, and are best handled, by their government
as internal matters. U.N. officials  also point to the politically charged milieu of allegations
o f drug trafficking by North Korea and point ou t that drug smuggling by individuals in the
diplomatic community is by no means limited to North Korea.
Issues for Congress.  At least thirty documented drug trafficking incidents coupled
 credible (if unproven) allegations of large scale North Korean state sponsorship o f
 poppy cultivation,  and heroin and methamphetamine production and trafficking,
raise significant  issues for Congress, the Administration, and Ame rica’s allies in combating
inte drug trafficking. The challenge to policy makers, is how to pursue soun d
counter drug policy and comply with U.S. law wh ich may require cutting off  aid to North
 while effectively pursuing other high priority U.S. foreign policy objective s
 (1) limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction; (2 )
l iting ballistic missile production and export; (3) curbing terrorism, counterfeiting and
i onal crime, and (4) addressing humanitarian needs. The State Department’s first
INCSR report on North Korea was released February 26, 1999.
Centra l to the policy debate is the need for hard data such as satellite imagery t o
confirm the extent of reported opium poppy cultivation in North Korea.  Enhancing law
enforc focus and intelligence cooperation on targeting, reporting, and trackin g
N orth Kore an opium/heroin and methamphetamine trafficking and production is another
option which warrants consideration.
